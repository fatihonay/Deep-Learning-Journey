The increasing demand for data acquisition in recent years has led to an explosion of datasets generated by different research centers and laboratories. However, sharing and reusing these datasets has been problematic due to the diversity of file formats and storage strategies adopted across laboratories. To address these challenges, the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) was introduced as a standardized framework for organizing, describing, and sharing neuroimaging and electrophysiological data.

Now,  review carefully data structure of BIDS format. As you can see, subject, session, task/rest are the main parts with a stantardized name structures. Thus, we can easily adapt ourselves to the other datasets from the other labs. This is very useful for scientists dealing with data and research at the same time. I recommend you to visit https://openneuro.org and discover what kind of neural datasets are shared in this platform.

## Downloading Dataset

OpenNeuro offers numerous publicly available datasets across different modalities. Reaching and using these datasets is only a few clicks away.



```{python}
import openneuro

# Check dataset name you want to download from Openneuro
dataset_name = "ds007020"
# Download (takes 5-10 min first time, then cached)
#openneuro.download(dataset=dataset_name,  target_dir="/content/dataset/Raw_EEG")
```
