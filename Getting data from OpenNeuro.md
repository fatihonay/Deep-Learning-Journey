The increasing demand for data acquisition in recent years has led to an explosion of datasets generated by different research centers and laboratories. However, sharing and reusing these datasets has been problematic due to the diversity of file formats and storage strategies adopted across laboratories. To address these challenges, the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) was introduced as a standardized framework for organizing, describing, and sharing neuroimaging and electrophysiological data.
