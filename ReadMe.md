Building deep learning models for specific problems and tasks are inevitable need for our world. Data is everywhere but without true strategy to handle it, we can not learn about the nature of the data. As a researcher dealing with neural data, I would like to test capabilities of deep learning models for solving the problems associated with human brain. For this purpose, I would like to construct understanding of basics using Python and its libraries for building these complex models.


| Component            | Library        | Purpose                                   |
|---------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Deep Learning       | PyTorch        | Neural network framework                  |
| EEG Processing      | MNE-Python     | EEG data handling and preprocessing       |
| Model Library       | Braindecode    | Pre-built EEG deep learning models        |
| Dataset Access      | MOABB          | Standardized EEG benchmark datasets       |
| Visualization       | Matplotlib     | Plotting and data visualization           |
| Visualization       | Seaborn        | Statistical data visualization            |
| Evaluation          | Scikit-learn   | Metrics, validation, and data splitting   |
