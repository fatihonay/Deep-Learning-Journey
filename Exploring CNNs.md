# Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional neural networks maybe the most popular and widely used deep learning models for broad range of applications including image classification, object detection, segmentation and medical imaging. Furthermore, BrainDecode library offers CNN models for analysis of EEG signals. Therefore, reviewing architecture of CNNs will help us to use and develop deep learning models in the future. I will try to keep this section simple as possible as I can.
