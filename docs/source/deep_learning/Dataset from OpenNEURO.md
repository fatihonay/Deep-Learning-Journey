# Downloading Dataset from OpenNEURO

The increasing demand for data acquisition in recent years has led to an explosion of datasets generated by different research centers and laboratories. However, sharing and reusing these datasets has been problematic due to the diversity of file formats and storage strategies adopted across laboratories. To address these challenges, the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) was introduced as a standardized framework for organizing, describing, and sharing neuroimaging and electrophysiological data.

Now,  review carefully data structure of BIDS format. As you can see, subject, session, task/rest are the main parts with a stantardized name structures. Thus, we can easily adapt ourselves to the other datasets from the other labs. This is very useful for scientists dealing with data and research at the same time. I recommend you to visit https://openneuro.org and discover what kind of neural datasets are shared in this platform.

OpenNeuro offers numerous publicly available datasets across different modalities. Reaching and using these datasets is only a few clicks away.

```python
import openneuro

# Check dataset name you want to download from Openneuro
dataset_name = "ds007020"

# Download (takes 5-10 min depending on size of dataset and internet speed)
openneuro.download(dataset=dataset_name,  target_dir="/content/dataset/Raw_EEG")
```

Note that target_dir indicates the location where we want to store dataset. You can choose as you desire. If you dont know how to effectively locate your dataset, I recommend you to use following stragey.

### Step 1: Find Your Current Working Directory
Before downloading, it's helpful to know **where** your files will be saved by default. Run this cell to see the current folder (working directory):

```{python}
import os

# Show the current working directory
print("Current working directory:", os.getcwd())

```


### Step 2: Create a Folder in Working Directory


```{python}
import os

# Example: create inside a "data" folder
base_dir = "dataset"
dataset_name = "Raw_EEG"

# Full folder path
target_dir = os.path.join(base_dir, dataset_name)

# Create all missing folders in the path
os.makedirs(target_dir, exist_ok=True)

print("Dataset will be saved to:", os.path.abspath(target_dir))
```

### Step 3:

```{python}

# The OpenNeuro dataset ID you want
dataset_name = "ds007020"   # ← change this to your desired dataset ID

# Use the folder from above (choose one of the variables)
target_dir = "Raw_EEG"                # Option A
# target_dir = os.path.join("data", "Raw_EEG")   # Option B

# Download (may take 5–30 minutes depending on size & connection)
openneuro.download(
    dataset=dataset_name,
    target_dir=target_dir
)

print("Download finished! Check your files here:", target_dir)
```
