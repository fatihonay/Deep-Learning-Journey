### Overview


Deep learning has revolutionized the analysis of neurophysiological signals. These tutorials will guide you through:

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Feature extraction from EEG signals
2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Temporal dynamics in brain signals (coming soon)
3. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: Latent representations of neural activity (coming soon)

### Why Deep Learning for EEG?

Traditional EEG analysis often requires manual feature engineering. Deep learning models can:

- Automatically learn relevant features from raw data
- Capture complex non-linear relationships
- Handle high-dimensional data efficiently
- Generalize across subjects and conditions
