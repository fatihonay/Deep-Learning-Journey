# EEG-Controlled Exoskeleton for Walking and Standing A Longitudinal Motor Imagery Study in Healthy Adults

Now, we will go through a big challenge.  We will try to understand and use BCI dataset for deploying a deep learning model. I think that you will find this dataset interesting and charming. I stumbled upon EEG-controlled exoskeleton BCI data when reviewing the OpenNEURO platform.  You can find it in the following link;

```{note}
This dataset contains multimodal recordings from a brain–machine interface (BMI) training study involving seven healthy adult participants (ages 20–30, Mean = 24.3, SD = 3.8). The study focused on open-loop and closed-loop control of a lower-limb exoskeleton (Rex Bionics) using EEG and inertial sensor data. Each participant completed nine sessions over several weeks, structured into training and trial phases.
