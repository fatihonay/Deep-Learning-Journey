# Deep Learning Journey

Building deep learning models for specific problems and tasks are inevitable need for our world. Data is everywhere but without true strategy to handle it, we can not learn about the nature of the data. As a researcher dealing with neural data, I would like to test capabilities of deep learning models for solving the problems associated with human brain. For this purpose, I would like to construct understanding of basics using Python and its libraries for building these complex models.

## Overview

I designed a simple table for what we will use during this journey.  I listed the fundamental libraries and their usage purposes for simplifying the our learning process.  
- MNE-Python is a standard library to load, pre-process, visualize EEG datasets. We will need this library to manage and prepare EEG data for Deep Learning tasks.
- Pytorch is highly popular and state-of-the-art deep learning library for building many different deep learning models.
- Braindecode is very useful and easy-to-use library to use ready-to-use deep learning models for wide range of applications for EEG datasets.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn are key libraries to visualize results and details during the process.
- Scikit-learn is a standard library to manages training of deep learning models and their performance.
