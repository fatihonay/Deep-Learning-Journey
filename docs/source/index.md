# Neural Variability Research

Welcome to the documentation for Neural Variability Research. This project provides tutorials and resources for computational neuroscience, focusing on EEG signal processing and deep learning applications.

```{note}
This documentation is under active development. New tutorials and content will be added regularly.
```

## Overview

This project covers:

- **Deep Learning for EEG**: Convolutional neural networks, recurrent models, and variational autoencoders for brain signal analysis
- **Signal Processing**: Preprocessing pipelines, time-frequency analysis, and entropy measures
- **Neural Variability**: Trial-to-trial variability analysis and its applications in Parkinson's disease research

## Getting Started

If you're new to this project, we recommend starting with the [](tutorials/index.md) section.
