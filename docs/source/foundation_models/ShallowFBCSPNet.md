# ShallowFBCSPNet

One of the pioneering deep learning model for EEG signal analysis is ShallowFBCSPNet. This model mainly consists of convolutional layers which extract spatiotemporal features from multichannel EEG signals. It has been proven to be very useful in BCI classification tasks.
In this section, I want to review architecture of this model and understand how to effectively use it for our problems. For the detailed informaiton, you can read the article titled "Deep Learning With Convolutional Neural Networks for EEG Decoding and Visualization".

```{note}
 ShallowFBCSPNet decodes task-related information from the raw EEG signals.
