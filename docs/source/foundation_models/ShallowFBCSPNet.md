# ShallowFBCSPNet

One of the pioneering deep learning model for EEG signal analysis is ShallowFBCSPNet. This model mainly consists of convolutional layers which extract spatiotemporal features from multichannel EEG signals. It has been proven to be very useful in BCI classification tasks.


```{note}
 ShallowFBCSPNet decodes task-related information from the raw EEG signals.
